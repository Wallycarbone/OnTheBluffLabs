      testimonial: "I was drawn to On The Bluff Labradors because of their philosophy, from their approach to nutrition and diet, vaccination insight, crate training, and socialization skills to their extensive experience in breeding. They were accommodating and helpful as we looked at possibly getting one of their puppies and all my questions. Having lost two dogs in the past year from the same litter to Osteosarcoma, I was still feeling anxious about whether I was ready for the next step. The research was essential to me, and like most, I wanted to do anything I could to be preventive for our future furries. Jessica was so patient with me, understanding and explaining, always available to answer any questions, and never once did I feel any pressure to move forward. They communicate often and go above and beyond to make the process of adding a new family member easy and seamless, from weekly updates, pre-pickup Zoom meetings, and a communicative pickup to review all the details. We can't say enough good things about our boy, Theodore, 'Teddy'â€” he settled right in winning his new big brother over in minutes, he's very handsome and expressive, intelligent, cuddly, friendly, was quickly housebroken, a great traveler, and a true sweetheart. His temperament and personality are exceptional. We have never had a labrador quite like this, and I am certain we will have another one from On The Bluff in the next year or two.",
