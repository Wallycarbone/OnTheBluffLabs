Studies have shown that dogs are often fully immunized with one vaccination if administered at 16 weeks or older. We believe that not all vaccinations are necessary. The only one required by law is rabies. The others are up to you. Just remember, you are the customer. This is your dog and you must advocate for them.

The first immunization is usually the DA2LPP. We recommend that you do not give this shot at all. It is never good to immunize a dog with more than one vaccination at a time. The wombo combo shots, which is what they are often called, contain multiple modified live viruses mixed with various bacteria. Some are long-term vaccinations and can last over 3 years or a lifetime while others are not and may not last a year or are unnecessary, to begin with. If your dog has an adverse reaction, you will not know which one is causing the reaction. For the remaining vaccinations, if you feel you need them, we recommend that you give them one at a time rather than as a combo vaccine.

After puppyhood, giving vaccines too often—especially when they aren’t needed—can put your dog at unnecessary risk without offering any real benefit. One of the best ways to avoid over-vaccinating is through antibody titer testing. This is a simple blood test that checks whether your dog is already protected against certain diseases.
A titer test measures the level of specific antibodies in the bloodstream. Antibodies are the immune system’s “memory” cells—they’re what your dog’s body produces after a vaccination or natural exposure to an illness. If the antibody level is high enough, it means your dog is still protected and doesn’t need another shot at that time.

The beauty of titer testing is that it takes the guesswork out of the equation. Instead of automatically re-vaccinating every year or two because “that’s the schedule,” you’re basing your decision on your dog’s actual immunity. This helps you avoid unnecessary vaccines, reduce the chance of side effects, and make vaccination choices that are tailored to your dog—not to a generic chart on the wall.
